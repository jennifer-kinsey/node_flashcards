# Flashcards

## Description

This is a simple NodeJS app built on the Express Framework. This was built following along with the Team Treehouse tutorial for Express.

It's a flashcard app featuring Pug templating, basic error handling, routing in express, HTTP GET and POST, form processing, and utilization of Middleware.
